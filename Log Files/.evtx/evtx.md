# What is evtx files ? 

.evtx files are Windows Event Log files. They are used by the Windows operating system to store logs of important system, security, and application activities.

## Types of evtx files

### Application.evtx
Events generated by user-mode applications (e.g., Microsoft Office, third-party apps, antivirus software)

#### Use in Security:
- Diagnosing application crashes or errors
- Identifying abnormal or suspicious application behavior
- Detecting malware abusing legitimate software

### System.evtx
System-level events (e.g., service start/stop, driver load, shutdowns)

#### Use in Security:
- Detecting unexpected reboots
- Tracing driver installations
- Discovering if critical services were stopped (possibly by malware)

### Security.evtx
Audit logs (login attempts, object access, privilege use)

#### Use in Security:
- Login attempts (e.g., Event ID 4624 = successful logon, 4625 = failed)
- Privilege escalations (e.g., Event ID 4672 = special privileges assigned)
- Account creation/deletion

Most important log for forensics and threat hunting

### Setup.evtx
Windows setup and update events

#### Use in Security:
- Identifying installation or system deployment times
- Tracing suspicious reinstallations or Windows upgrades
- Can indicate reimaging used to wipe traces

### ForwardedEvents.evtx
Logs received from other computers via event forwarding

#### Use in Security:
- Centralizing logs from multiple endpoints
- Useful for enterprise-wide detection and correlation

### Windows PowerShell.evtx
PowerShell execution logs (if logging is enabled)

#### Use in Security:
- Monitoring PowerShell command execution (ID 4104 = script block execution)
- Tracking malicious or obfuscated PowerShell use (common in attacks)

### Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity.evtx
Events from Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

#### Use in Security:
- Detecting malicious WMI usage (e.g., for persistence or remote code execution)
Example: attacks using wmic or Win32_Process to launch payloads
