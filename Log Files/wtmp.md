# Reading a wtpmp file from unix systems

What is the wtpmp file ? 

The wtmp file serves as a system log that records all login and logout activities. This file is in binary format and is usually found at /var/log/wtmp. To view its contents, you can use the last command, which displays a historical record of user sessions, including logins, logouts, system restarts, and changes in runlevel.

Information Contained in wtmp
Because wtmp is a binary file, it cannot be read like plain text logs such as auth.log. However, tools like last interpret and present the data in a human-readable format, including:

- Username: Identifies the user who logged in or out.
- Terminal: Specifies the terminal (TTY) used for the session. Remote sessions often indicate SSH or Telnet details.
- IP Address or Hostname: For remote sessions, this shows the originating IP address or hostname.
- Login Time: The date and time when the session began.
- Logout Time: When the session ended or the user logged out.
- Session Duration: The total length of the session.

Below is a sample output of the last command:

SegfaultBreaker pts/0 10.1.1.1 Sat April 9 09:25 - 10:25 (01:00).

The user Segfaulbreaker was logged in for 1h. 


## Important

It is important to understand that problems may arise when using standard tools like last or utmpdump if the CPU architecture of the forensic investigatorâ€™s machine differs from that of the system where the wtmp file was originally created. To address this issue, use a tool called utmp.py (https://gist.github.com/4n6ist/99241df331bb06f393be935f82f036a5).

|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type**   | Specifies the type of record, such as user login, logout, system boot, or shutdown event.            |
| **PID**    | The Process ID associated with the event.                                                             |
| **Line**   | The terminal line where the session occurred. `tty` refers to a physical terminal (e.g., local console), while `pts` refers to a pseudo-terminal used for remote or virtual sessions (e.g., SSH). |
| **ID**     | A short identifier linked to the terminal line.                                                       |
| **User**   | The username involved in the event.                                                                   |
| **Host**   | The hostname or IP address from which the user accessed the system, if applicable.                   |
| **Exit**   | The exit status of the session or process.                                                            |
| **Session**| The session identifier.                                                                               |
| **sec**    | The event timestamp in seconds (based on your system's timezone, not the source system's).           |
| **usec**   | The microsecond part of the timestamp related to the login/logout event.                              |
| **Addr**   | Additional address info, such as an IP address for remote connections.                                |
