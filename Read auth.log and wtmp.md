# Reading a auth.log file from unix systems

What is the auth.log file ? 

The auth.log file is mainly utilized to record events related to authentication processes. Each time a user tries to log in, switch accounts, or carry out an action that requires authentication, a corresponding log entry is created. 
This includes operations involving the SSH daemon (sshd), the use of sudo, and cron jobs that require authentication.

| **Hostname**    | ip-192-168-10-45     | The hostname or internal IP address of the server where the log was generated. |

| **Event Type**  | Failed password      | Indicates an unsuccessful attempt to authenticate due to a wrong password.     |

# Reading a wtpmp file from unix systems

What is the wtpmp file ? 

The wtmp file serves as a system log that records all login and logout activities. This file is in binary format and is usually found at /var/log/wtmp. To view its contents, you can use the last command, which displays a historical record of user sessions, including logins, logouts, system restarts, and changes in runlevel.

Information Contained in wtmp
Because wtmp is a binary file, it cannot be read like plain text logs such as auth.log. However, tools like last interpret and present the data in a human-readable format, including:

- Username: Identifies the user who logged in or out.
- Terminal: Specifies the terminal (TTY) used for the session. Remote sessions often indicate SSH or Telnet details.
- IP Address or Hostname: For remote sessions, this shows the originating IP address or hostname.
- Login Time: The date and time when the session began.
- Logout Time: When the session ended or the user logged out.
- Session Duration: The total length of the session.

Below is a sample output of the last command:

SegfaultBreaker pts/0 10.1.1.1 Sat April 9 09:25 - 10:25 (01:00).

The user Segfaulbreaker was logged in for 1h. 


## Important

It is important to understand that problems may arise when using standard tools like last or utmpdump if the CPU architecture of the forensic investigatorâ€™s machine differs from that of the system where the wtmp file was originally created. To address this issue, use a tool called utmp.py (https://gist.github.com/4n6ist/99241df331bb06f393be935f82f036a5).

| **User**   | The username involved in the event.                                                                   |
