# Reading a auth.log file from unix systems

What is the auth.log file ? 

The auth.log file is mainly utilized to record events related to authentication processes. Each time a user tries to log in, switch accounts, or carry out an action that requires authentication, a corresponding log entry is created. 
This includes operations involving the SSH daemon (sshd), the use of sudo, and cron jobs that require authentication.
