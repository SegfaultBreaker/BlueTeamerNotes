# Volatility Overview for Memory Forensics

Volatility is a freely available framework designed for analyzing computer memory, widely used in digital investigations and malware detection. Developed in Python, it works across multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The tool was created based on foundational research in memory forensics and has become a core utility for cybersecurity professionals.

Volatility enables users to interact with memory dump files in various ways, such as:
- Displaying a list of currently or previously active processes
- Identifying both active and terminated network connections
- Viewing browsing activity from Internet Explorer
- Locating files that existed on the system and extracting them from memory
- Accessing the text contents from Notepad sessions
- Recovering typed commands from the Windows command-line interface
- Scanning memory for malware using YARA pattern-matching rules
- Extracting screenshots and clipboard data
- Recovering hashed passwords and security credentials
- Dumping SSL/TLS certificates and cryptographic keys
- And much more
